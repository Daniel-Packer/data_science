Different Projects:

-ELO Predictor
    Quantitative Prediction
    Need more data than GID
    Divide into different time controls.
    Look at "Motifs" (in preprocessing the data)
        Then learn on its own the implications of that motif

-Grandmaster ID
    Classifier
    Need only Grandmaster games
    Probably easiest to test if the player is specifically Carlsen
    Relevant article on the arXiv: 
    Concern: Carlsen just wins, so the winner would be a really good
predictor.

Ask Lindsay about which one seems more feasible.

Consider time data for both.
Lichess vs Chess.com
    Lichess more open source,
    Both have APIs, though.

We need to actually learn machine learning sooner rather than later.

More components:
    Look at how people attempt to predict elo.

Pretty advanced stuff had a pretty poor prediction rate, but was also being
run on slower games. With faster games, we might be able to get better
heterogenity.
